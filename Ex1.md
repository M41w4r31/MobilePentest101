# Exercise 1: Insecure Logging

This exercise focuses on understanding the risks associated with insecure logging practices in Android applications.

## Steps to Perform the Exercise:

1. **Install the APK with ADB:**
   - Use the following command to install the APK file named `DivaApplication.apk`:
     ```
     adb install DivaApplication.apk
     ```

2. **Get a Shell in the Emulator:**
   - Use the following command to get a shell in the emulator:
     ```
     adb shell
     ```

3. **Open the Application in the Emulator:**
   - Launch the installed application in the emulator.

4. **Choose the Insecure Logging Exercise:**
   - Within the application, navigate to the exercises section.
   - Choose the exercise labeled "Insecure Logging".

5. **Enter Sensitive Information:**
   - In the input field provided, enter a random or dummy credit card number. For example: `1234123412341234`.

6. **Access Logcat:**
   - While the application is running, use the following command to access logcat:
     ```
     logcat | grep diva
     ```

7. **Review the Logs:**
   - Examine the logcat output. You should observe the credit card number displayed in plaintext within the logs.

## Note:
   - Insecure logging practices can expose sensitive user information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, to potential attackers.
   - Developers should ensure that sensitive information is not logged or stored in an insecure manner within their applications.
